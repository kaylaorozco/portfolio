                    <p>Living on the West Side of San Antonio, there have been many times where I have encountered danger or knew someone who had. Even when I was a young college student who walked alone at night to get to my car, there often was a sense of danger that could be felt. For many, when dangerous situations arise, the ability to silently and quietly
                        contact authorities and loved ones is not available. Knight Watch is a mobile app, with the smartwatch companion app, that provides a reliable, quick way to alert authorities and loved ones while also providing a sense of comfort.

                                1. Almost 90% of those surveyed live in the city or suburbs which means they are near others frequently.<br>

                    <p>After we iterated on our lofi-wireframes, I helped to create and apply the style guide to make our high-fidelity wireframes. We wanted the app to have a modern look with the tone of safety and reassurance for the user.

                        2. The ability to arm/disarm the app when needed<br>

                        <p>Along with our final prototype, I designed a companion smartwatch app for Knight Watch. In our original interviews, a little over 30% of interviewees
                            had a smartwatch, and if they didn't have one currently, they wanted one in the future. The companion smartwatch app would be useful in times of danger if the user could not reach their phone.

                    <p>During our competitor analysis, we observed that the other emergency alert apps had to be opened to activate it. We felt that this defeated the purpose of a quick, accessible way to alert authorities so I designed a way for the “Rescue” button to be activated through the lock screen.

                    <p>As a team, it was a privilege to work on an app that addresses such a large need that many people are faced with. Along the way, we came up with a few more features for Knight Watch for the future:<br><br>
                        1. Voice Activation, in case you cannot reach your phone<br>
                        2. Access to the Smartwatch Version without mobile on-hand<br>

                    <p>This last feature was actually presented in one of our user interviews, but with the current climate of police brutality and the present threat of racism, we felt it was best that this feature be addressed with a larger team and more time to brainstorm about these problems.
