                <p>As we began our research, we quickly discovered that SBOs did not have a lot of time, as they would not respond or they would turn us away. With persistence, I was able to conduct a few interviews and send out a survey to 2 different small-business pages on Facebook.

                    1. Running a small-business is very time consuming so SBOs need simpler ways to communicate with customers<br>
                    2. There was a common theme of confusion amongst their customers<br>
                    3. SBOs struggled with getting their customers on the same page with their covid protocols<br> 
                    4. This new information SBOs had to communicate was creating pressure</p>

The process of sending out a notification was kept to a four-step solution that allowed the user to put in the necessary information, while also having the option to use the same information to make a social media post. Combining the two types of posts/notifications saves time for the busy small-business owners.

They were very happy that there was an application that was dedicated to helping SBOs, especially in such a difficult time as a pandemic. One of the problems that arose was the familiarity with geofencing, but once it was understood they thought it was a great idea. With this problem being stated, one way we could solve it would be to put a clearer explanation of it in our Onboarding process.
